# Pokemon-trainer
This repository contains the scripts for the Pokémon trainer application given as a mandatory exercise. In this application, a "trainer" can "catch" pokémon from the "Pokémon catalogue" page, and release them in the same page. There is also a profile page where the trainer can view all caught pokémon. The trainer can also release pokémon from this page. A trainer must log in from the start page called the "login" page. 

## Potential future features
Pagination feature, meaning instead of loading every pokémon on single page, only a selected number of pokémons are shown on a single page. The user could then navigate forward to new pages of pokémon instead of scrolling endlessly.
